## Features

- üîí Secure token implementation with pause mechanism
- üíß Built-in faucet functionality for token distribution
- üéØ Maximum supply cap enforcement
- üîê Owner-controlled minting and burning
- ‚ö° Gas-optimized operations
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection against common vulnerabilities

## Contract Details

- **Name**: Configurable during deployment
- **Symbol**: Configurable during deployment
- **Decimals**: Configurable during deployment
- **Initial Supply**: Set at deployment
- **Maximum Cap**: Immutable, set at deployment
- **Faucet Amount**: Immutable, set at deployment

## Functions

### Token Information

- `contractOwner()`: Get contract owner's address
- `name()`: Get token name
- `symbol()`: Get token symbol
- `decimals()`: Get token decimals
- `totalSupply()`: Get current total supply
- `cap()`: Get maximum token cap
- `faucetAmount()`: Get claimable faucet amount
- `isPaused()`: Get contract's pause state
- `balanceOf(address)`: Get account balance
- `allowance(address, address)`: Get approved spending amount

### Token Operations

- `transfer(address, uint256)`: Transfer tokens
- `approve(address, uint256)`: Approve token spending
- `transferFrom(address, address, uint256)`: Transfer tokens using allowance
- `increaseAllowance(address, uint256)`: Increase spending allowance
- `decreaseAllowance(address, uint256)`: Decrease spending allowance
- `claimFaucet()`: Claim tokens from faucet (one-time per address)

### Owner Operations

- `transferOwnership(address)`: Transfer ownership
- `mint(uint256)`: Create new tokens (within cap)
- `burn(uint256)`: Destroy tokens
- `pause()`: Pause all token operations
- `unpause()`: Resume token operations

## Security Features

- Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Owner-only administrative functions
- Zero-address transfer protection
- Cap enforcement for total supply
- One-time faucet claims per address

## Usage

### Deployment

Deploy the contract with the following parameters:

```solidity
constructor(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    uint8 decimals_,
    uint256 initialSupply,
    uint256 cap_,
    uint256 faucetAmount_
)
```

### Interacting with the Contract

#### Transfer Tokens

```javascript
// Transfer 100 tokens to recipient
await token.transfer(recipientAddress, ethers.utils.parseUnits("100", 18));
```

#### Approve Spending

```javascript
// Approve spender to use 1000 tokens
await token.approve(spenderAddress, ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18));
```

#### Claim from Faucet

```javascript
// Claim tokens from faucet
await token.claimFaucet();
```
